Eye Disease Detection and Classification with the Help of Machine Learning:

This is a web application where customers need to upload a fundus eye image. Once they click on "predict," it will provide information about the eye disease and the probability of it being normal.

In this project, I utilized the DenseNet-121 model to train my machine learning algorithm with the help of deep learning techniques implemented using TensorFlow. Furthermore, I employed Flask, HTML, and CSS for the user interface and web application.

Our project's motto is to create an application that enables individuals to identify possible eye diseases in their eyes at an early stage. By detecting these diseases early, we can explore potential cures before they worsen. Additionally, traditional methods of diagnosing eye diseases can be quite expensive. Therefore, our application offers a cost-effective alternative for those who cannot afford traditional diagnostic methods.
